Sporting teal-green locks hidden beneath a brown hat that obscures his eyes, Garcello dons a gray/black hoodie over a plain white tee, complemented by turquoise pants and brown boots, all while puffing on a distinctive green cigarette. The smoke he exhales, including the tip of his cigarette, synchronizes with the arrow colors, hinting at a fantasy drug rather than tobacco. As the tracks unfold, Garcello's journey takes poignant turns, from experiencing physical distress in \"Nerves\" to his ghostly transformation in \"Release,\" marked by spectral smoke emissions.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
