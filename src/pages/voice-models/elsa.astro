Initially depicted in her youth by Eva Bella and later as a teenager by Spencer Lacey Ganus, Elsa, created by co-writers and directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, draws inspiration from Hans Christian Andersen's character, the Snow Queen. Within Disney's adaptation, she emerges as the first princess of the fictional Scandinavian kingdom of Arendelle, heiress to the throne, and elder sister to Princess Anna (voiced by Kristen Bell). Elsa is depicted as possessing cryogenic powers, inadvertently plunging Arendelle into eternal winter on her coronation day. Throughout the film, she grapples with controlling and embracing her abilities while striving to overcome her fears without causing harm. The character's evolution from a potential villain, akin to the Snow Queen in the original tale, to a sympathetic, misunderstood protagonist was a result of deliberations between Buck, Lee, and Disney executives, culminating in Elsa's portrayal as a complex figure, occasionally vexed but ultimately pivotal to the narrative.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
