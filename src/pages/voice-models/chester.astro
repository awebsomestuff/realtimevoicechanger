His main attack involves hurling three rattles. His supers range from explosive (artillery-type) to stunning (long-range shot), poisoning (emitting gas akin to Emz), slowing down enemies (creating an area similar to Spike's super), and healing (a candy appears above his head, gradually restoring health points). The super remains invisible unless you possess Chester's second star power, making it somewhat unpredictable.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
