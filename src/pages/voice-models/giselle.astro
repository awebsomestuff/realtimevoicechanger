Introduced during a press conference on October 28, 2020, through a video revealing the final lineup of aespa, Giselle was officially announced as a member on October 30. She was the fourth and final member to be revealed. With a Korean mother and a Japanese father, she is fluent in Korean, English, and Japanese. Giselle spent four years in her school choir as a contralto and had a brief training period of less than a year, making her the SM Entertainment female idol with the shortest training period. She is the second Japanese female idol (fourth overall) to debut under SM Entertainment. Her favorite color is black, and she has a penchant for R&B music. For her audition at SM, she performed CL's \"Lifted\" and NCT 127's \"Cherry Bomb.\" Giselle was also a standout athlete in her school's outdoor season of 2017, representing her school in high jump. She personally wrote the lyrics for her SYNK teaser in three different languages (Korean, English, and Japanese). Before joining SM as a trainee, she trained at the AJS Global Idol Training School. Giselle looks up to Ariana Grande as her role model and has attended her concerts multiple times in Japan. Her aunt is Johee Cho, the head of ABC News' Seoul office and a reporter.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
