At 25 years old (as of the game's 2013 release), he's portrayed as an ambitious young man who initially resides in a modest home in South Los Santos with his aunt Denise Clinton, eventually upgrading to a mansion in Vinewood Hills. His employment under Armenian luxury car dealer Simeon Yetarian leads him to encounter Michael De Santa after repossessing Michael's son Jimmy's flashy yellow BeeJay XL, subsequently introducing him to Trevor Philips. While a member of the Families, Franklin opts to steer clear of gang involvement during the events of the game. He owns a pet dog named Chop and drives a customized Buffalo S as his preferred vehicle. Franklin made his debut appearance alongside Michael in the first trailer for Grand Theft Auto V, released in November 2011.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
