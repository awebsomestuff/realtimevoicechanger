He was mentored by Future Gohan and trained under Kaio-shin, utilizing his Time Machine to journey to Son Goku's timeline from an apocalyptic future. As the last stronghold of the Future Z Warriors, he's undeniably one of Dragon Ball's most recurring figures, whether as a lead or a supporting character. His notable appearances in the present timeline include pivotal moments such as defeating Freeza, aiding Son Goku and his allies against the Androids and Cell, and later joining forces with the Z Warriors against Goku Black and Future Zamasu in the Future Trunks Arc.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n \n\n</div>";
