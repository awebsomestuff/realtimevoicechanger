Preceding her, a character named Donna Duck appeared in the short film Don Donald, leading to occasional confusion about whether they are the same character. Daisy is primarily known as Donald's girlfriend, although she occasionally goes on dates with Gladstone Gander in the comics. She shares Donald's temper but is a bit more sophisticated. According to Don Rosa's comics, Daisy is the sister of Huey, Dewey, and Louie's father, making her their aunt. Additionally, one of her sisters is the mother of the triplet girls April, May, and June, who are counterparts to Donald's nephews. Initially a minor character, Daisy's importance grew over time, leading her to become part of Mickey Mouse's main group of friends.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
