Additionally, he is considered the counterpart of Universe 6's Frost. This tyrannical emperor is responsible for the deaths of Bardock and Gine, Son Goku's parents, as well as King Vegeta and most of his species, the Saiyans of Planet Vegeta, resulting in an ethnic cleansing known as the Saiyan Genocide. He appears as the main antagonist in the Namek and Freeza Arcs of Dragon Ball Z, a secondary antagonist in the Androids and Cell Arcs, then returns resurrected as the main antagonist in the Golden Freeza Arc (as well as in the movie Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F'), later becoming a conditional ally of the Z Warriors and Goku under Universe 7's Team in the Universal Survival Arc of Dragon Ball Super. In the spin-off anime Dragon Ball GT, he serves as a secondary antagonist in the Ultimate Android Arc. For these reasons and more, he is regarded as the flagship villain of the Dragon Ball franchise, Goku's archenemy, and the worst rival of his former ally, the Saiyan prince, Vegeta.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
