Rising to prominence during the silent film era, Chaplin's iconic character, Charlot, captivated audiences worldwide, earning him a reputation as a symbol of humor and silent cinema. With roots in the entertainment world through his parents, Chaplin's early years saw him debut in theater at the age of five, eventually touring with Fred Karno's theatrical company. However, it was in 1914 that his legendary character Charlot made his debut, leading Chaplin to create numerous iconic films, including The Gold Rush (1925), City Lights (1931), Modern Times (1936), and The Great Dictator (1940). Known for his mastery of slapstick, mime, and visual comedy, Chaplin's directorial skills flourished as he helmed the majority of his films and even composed music for them. In 1919, he co-founded United Artists alongside other prominent figures in the industry. Despite facing political controversies and exile due to his alleged communist affiliations, Chaplin's legacy endured, marked by honorary Oscars, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and knighthood. His final films, A King in New York and A Countess from Hong Kong, were completed in Switzerland, where he spent his remaining years until his passing.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"related-models\">\n  <h2>Related Voice Models</h2>\n  <div class=\"related-models-grid\">\n    <div class=\"icono\">\n      <a href=\"/voice-models/gilbert-gottfried/\">\n        <img class=\"imagen-icono\" src=\"/uploads/2024/04/Gilbert-Gottfried-Voice-Models-280x280.webp\" srcset=\"/uploads/2024/04/Gilbert-Gottfried-Voice-Models-280x280.webp 280w\" sizes=\"140px\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Gilbert Gottfried\">\n        <div class=\"texto-icono\">Gilbert Gottfried</div>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"icono\">\n      <a href=\"/voice-models/brad-pitt/\">\n        <img class=\"imagen-icono\" src=\"/uploads/2024/04/Brad-Pitt-280x280.webp\" srcset=\"/uploads/2024/04/Brad-Pitt-280x280.webp 280w\" sizes=\"140px\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Brad Pitt\">\n        <div class=\"texto-icono\">Brad Pitt</div>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"icono\">\n      <a href=\"/voice-models/charlie-sheen/\">\n        <img class=\"imagen-icono\" src=\"/uploads/2024/04/Charlie-Sheen-Voice-Models-280x280.webp\" srcset=\"/uploads/2024/04/Charlie-Sheen-Voice-Models-280x280.webp 280w\" sizes=\"140px\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Charlie Sheen\">\n        <div class=\"texto-icono\">Charlie Sheen</div>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"icono\">\n      <a href=\"/voice-models/eddie-murphy/\">\n        <img class=\"imagen-icono\" src=\"/uploads/2024/04/Eddie-Murphy-Voice-Models-280x280.webp\" srcset=\"/uploads/2024/04/Eddie-Murphy-Voice-Models-280x280.webp 280w\" sizes=\"140px\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Eddie Murphy\">\n        <div class=\"texto-icono\">Eddie Murphy</div>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"icono\">\n      <a href=\"/voice-models/denzel-washington/\">\n        <img class=\"imagen-icono\" src=\"/uploads/2024/04/Denzel-Washinton-Voice-Models-280x280.webp\" srcset=\"/uploads/2024/04/Denzel-Washinton-Voice-Models-280x280.webp 280w\" sizes=\"140px\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Denzel Washington\">\n        <div class=\"texto-icono\">Denzel Washington</div>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>";
