In her base form, she moves quickly and has a long-range attack that fires two projectiles in quick succession, though each deals minimal damage. Her Super transforms her into a Mecha, significantly boosting her health and altering her attack and Super abilities. As a Mecha, Meg shoots two parallel bursts of energy rays and her Super deals substantial damage across a wide arc. She is equipped with two gadgets: the \"Electric Discharge,\" which temporarily heals her Mecha, and the \"Toolbox,\" which drops a toolbox that boosts the reload speed of Meg and her allies within its range. Her Star Powers include \"Force Field,\" providing a long-lasting damage reduction shield after her Mecha is destroyed, and \"Self-Destruct,\" which damages and knocks back nearby enemies upon the Mecha's destruction.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n";
