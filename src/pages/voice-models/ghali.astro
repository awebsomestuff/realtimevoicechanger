His breakthrough came in 2016 with the release of the hit song Ninna Nanna in Italy. The following year, he released Pizza Kebab and collaborated on Bimbi with Charlie Charles, Izi, Rkomi, Sfera Ebbasta, and Tedua. Ghali's debut album, Album, dropped in 2017, followed by singles like Cara Italia in 2018 and I Love You, Turbococco and Hasta la vista in 2019. In 2020, he released his second album titled DNA and followed it up with a series of singles, many of which were remixes from DNA, featuring artists like Pyrex, Anna, and Don Patricio. Later in 2020, Ghali expanded DNA with the release of DNA DELUXE X, including two new songs and previous year's singles. His third album, Sensazione Ultra, dropped on May 18, 2022, showcasing Ghali's more personal side and increased use of Arabic in his lyrics, reflecting his Tunisian heritage. Notably, the album features Bayna, predominantly written in Arabic and named after a humanitarian aid ship in the Mediterranean (Mediterranearescue Project). Following the release of Sensazione Ultra, Ghali embarked on a European tour, marking his first performances outside of Italy, with stops in cities like Madrid, Paris, and London.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
