He is the ninth member to join the crew after consuming the Yomi Yomi Fruit, which granted him life after death. Initially a royal guard and then a member of the Rumbar Pirates, Brook became a skeleton due to his soul taking too long to find his body. He joined the Straw Hats during the Thriller Bark arc, driven by a dream to reunite with his old friend Laboon at Reverse Mountain. His bounty has notably increased over time, reflecting his significant contributions to the crew's adventures.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n";
