Initially introduced as a grumpy foil to the increasingly laid-back Mickey Mouse, Donald quickly became the star of his own animated series. Under the pens of esteemed American writers like Al Taliaferro and later Carl Barks, Donald's comic universe expanded with a plethora of new characters and narratives, somewhat overshadowing his own importance. Despite his dwindling presence in the film world, Donald remains immensely popular in Scandinavia, Northern Europe, and Italy, even surpassing Mickey Mouse in some regions. In Sweden, he reigns as Disney's most beloved character, boasting his own magazine with a circulation exceeding 400,000 copies. Known in full as Donald Fauntleroy Duck, his name appears notably in his military draft notice during World War II, showcasing his enduring presence in both comics and cultural consciousness.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
