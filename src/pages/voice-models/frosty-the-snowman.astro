Inspired by the success of Autry's rendition of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer the year prior, Rollins and Nelson presented Frosty to Autry, hoping for another holiday hit. The song, like Rudolph, found its way into various forms of media, including a cherished television special.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
