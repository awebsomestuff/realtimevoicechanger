He possesses moderate health and high damage capability. Griff attacks by firing three bursts of three coins each, spreading in a cone shape. His Super involves throwing five bills that move forward and return to him, dealing more damage the further they travel and also spreading in a cone. His first gadget, \"Piggy Bank,\" drops a piggy bank that explodes after a delay, causing area damage and pushing enemies back while destroying obstacles. His second gadget, \"Coin Shower,\" allows his next attack to fire four waves of coins. His first Star Power, \"Keep the Change,\" speeds up the unloading of his attack. His second Star Power, \"Business Resilience,\" periodically restores a fraction of his lost health.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n";
