He has the unique ability to turn invisible, making him a formidable opponent in sneak attacks and ambushes. Leon's health is moderate, but his strength lies in his agility and the ability to close distances quickly to deal devastating damage before slipping away unseen.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Main Attack: Spinner Blades</strong> - Leon throws a set of four spinning blades that fan out and retract as they travel. This attack deals significant damage at close range, but the damage decreases as the distance increases, encouraging players to get up close and personal with their targets.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Super: Smoke Bomb</strong> - Leon's Super allows him to become invisible for a short duration, enabling him to escape or position himself for attacks without being seen by opponents. The invisibility duration decreases if Leon attacks or takes damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-525 aligncenter\" src=\"/uploads/2024/04/Leon.webp\" alt=\"Leon Voice Model\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" />";
