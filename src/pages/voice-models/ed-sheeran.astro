His musical journey began in childhood, singing in his church choir and learning to play the guitar. At the age of 16, he left secondary school and moved to London to pursue his artistic career. After independently releasing an EP in early 2011, he caught the attention of Elton John, who connected him with Asylum Records, leading to a recording contract. Sheeran's debut album +, released in September 2011, achieved commercial success, with hit singles like The A Team, which earned a Grammy nomination for Song of the Year. In 2012, he won the British Breakthrough Act and British Solo Male Artist awards at the Brit Awards. Sheeran toured as the opening act for Taylor Swift during parts of her Red Tour in 2013 and was nominated for Best New Artist at the Grammy Awards in 2014.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
