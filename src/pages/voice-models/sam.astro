He boasts considerable health and variable damage output. Unique to Sam is his ability to start matches with his super already charged. His attacks involve swift, dual strikes that deal increased damage when equipped with his knucklebusters. His super involves either throwing or summoning his knucklebusters, damaging enemies along their path and modifying his attack style. Additionally, Sam can recharge his super by retrieving his knucklebusters. His first gadget, \"Magnetic Field,\" pulls enemies towards his knucklebusters, while his second gadget, \"Repelling Pulse,\" causes his next super to push enemies around the knucklebusters upon impact. His first Star Power, \"Heal Today, Not Tomorrow,\" heals a portion of his lost health upon retrieving his knucklebusters, and his second Star Power, \"Remote Reload,\" automatically recharges his super when enemies are near his knucklebusters.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n";
