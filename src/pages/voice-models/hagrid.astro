He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1940, where he was sorted into Gryffindor House. In his third year, Hagrid was wrongly accused by Tom Riddle of opening the Chamber of Secrets because of his pet Acromantula, Aragog, whom Riddle claimed attacked several Muggle-born students and killed one. Although Hagrid was expelled and his wand was broken, Albus Dumbledore arranged for him to stay at Hogwarts as the gamekeeper. In 1991, Hagrid reintroduced Harry Potter to the wizarding world. By 1993, he became the professor for Care of Magical Creatures following Professor Kettleburn’s retirement. A member of both the original and reconstituted Order of the Phoenix, Hagrid fought in several battles during the First and Second Wizarding Wars, including the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998. As of 2017, he was still likely teaching at Hogwarts and serving as the gamekeeper.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"related-models\">\n  <h2>Related Voice Models</h2>\n  <div class=\"related-models-grid\">\n    <div class=\"icono\">\n      <a href=\"/voice-models/anakin-skywalker/\">\n        <img class=\"imagen-icono\" src=\"/uploads/2024/04/Anakin-skywalker-280x280.webp\" srcset=\"/uploads/2024/04/Anakin-skywalker-280x280.webp 280w\" sizes=\"140px\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Anakin Skywalker\">\n        <div class=\"texto-icono\">Anakin Skywalker</div>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"icono\">\n      <a href=\"/voice-models/black-panther/\">\n        <img class=\"imagen-icono\" src=\"/uploads/2024/04/black-panther-280x280.webp\" srcset=\"/uploads/2024/04/black-panther-280x280.webp 280w\" sizes=\"140px\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Black Panther\">\n        <div class=\"texto-icono\">Black Panther</div>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"icono\">\n      <a href=\"/voice-models/captain-jack-sparrow/\">\n        <img class=\"imagen-icono\" src=\"/uploads/2024/04/Captain-Jack-Sparrow-280x280.webp\" srcset=\"/uploads/2024/04/Captain-Jack-Sparrow-280x280.webp 280w\" sizes=\"140px\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Captain Jack Sparrow\">\n        <div class=\"texto-icono\">Captain Jack Sparrow</div>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"icono\">\n      <a href=\"/voice-models/borat/\">\n        <img class=\"imagen-icono\" src=\"/uploads/2024/04/Borat-280x280.webp\" srcset=\"/uploads/2024/04/Borat-280x280.webp 280w\" sizes=\"140px\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Borat\">\n        <div class=\"texto-icono\">Borat</div>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"icono\">\n      <a href=\"/voice-models/bruce-wayne-harley-quinn-show/\">\n        <img class=\"imagen-icono\" src=\"/uploads/2024/04/Bruce-wayne-280x280.webp\" srcset=\"/uploads/2024/04/Bruce-wayne-280x280.webp 280w\" sizes=\"140px\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Bruce Wayne (Harley Quinn Show)\">\n        <div class=\"texto-icono\">Bruce Wayne (Harley Quinn Show)</div>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"icono\">\n      <a href=\"/voice-models/gandalf/\">\n        <img class=\"imagen-icono\" src=\"/uploads/2024/04/Gandalf-Voice-Models-280x280.webp\" srcset=\"/uploads/2024/04/Gandalf-Voice-Models-280x280.webp 280w\" sizes=\"140px\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Gandalf\">\n        <div class=\"texto-icono\">Gandalf</div>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>";
