Renowned for his poignant storytelling, many of his songs delve into the lives of the marginalized, rebels, and prostitutes, while also critiquing the hierarchy of the Catholic Church. His lyrics, some of which are in the Ligurian language, are studied as significant expressions of 20th-century Italian poetry. Often referred to as Faber, a nickname bestowed upon him by childhood friend Paolo Villaggio due to his fondness for Faber Castell pencils, De André prioritized quality over quantity during his four-decade musical career, producing a relatively modest fifteen albums. His enduring popularity and artistic prowess led to numerous institutions commemorating him with streets, squares, parks, libraries, and schools following his passing.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
