His \"seven dirty words\" monologue played a pivotal role in a Supreme Court corruption case, solidifying his reputation as a countercultural comedy icon. Carlin's HBO stand-up specials, starting from 1977, highlighted his socio-cultural critiques of American society, focusing on contemporary political issues and satirizing American culture's excesses. He was a frequent guest on The Tonight Show during Johnny Carson's era and hosted the first episode of Saturday Night Live in 1975. Carlin's final HBO special, \"It's Bad for Ya,\" was filmed less than four months before his death from a heart attack in 2008. He was posthumously awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in 2008 and was ranked second on Rolling Stone's list of the 50 greatest stand-up comedians of all time in 2017. Additionally, he held the second position on Comedy Central's 2004 list of \"The 10 Greatest American Stand-Up Comedians.\"</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
