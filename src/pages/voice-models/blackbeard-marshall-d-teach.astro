Teach, better known as Blackbeard, is a formidable character in the \"One Piece\" series. As the admiral of the Blackbeard Pirates and one of the Four Emperors of the New World, he solidified his power after winning the Battle of the Vengeance against the Whitebeard Pirates. Originally a pirate apprentice in Whitebeard's crew, Teach dramatically rose to infamy by betraying his division commander, Portgas D. Ace, and facilitating a massive prison break from Impel Down, marking him as a key antagonist in the series.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
