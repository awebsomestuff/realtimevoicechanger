When Carl attacks, he swings his pickaxe, which damages and pierces any enemy in its path as it flies forward and returns, using up his only piece of ammunition that recharges upon its return. His Super ability causes him to spin rapidly with his pickaxe, doubling his movement speed and damaging nearby enemies. Carl's Volcanic Rocks Gadget leaves a trail of burning rocks, while his Tow Hook Gadget propels him to the furthest point of his attack range. His Protective Pirouette Star Power grants him a 30% damage reduction shield during his Super, enhancing his battlefield resilience.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
