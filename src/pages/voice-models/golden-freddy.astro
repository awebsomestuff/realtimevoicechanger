He debuted as a secret antagonist in the first game, appearing as a golden version of Freddy Fazbear. Throughout the series, his appearance varies, displaying traits of both Freddy and Fredbear, with a decrepit look and loose wires. In Five Nights at Freddy's AR: Special Delivery, he is shown as completely golden and brighter. In the Ultimate Custom Night, his role is central in theories suggesting he is the vengeful soul behind the events. His personality is cunning and silent, with an aura of mystery and vengeance, as evidenced by his sadistic laughter in the first game. In summary, Golden Freddy is a powerful and enigmatic antagonist in the history of Five Nights at Freddy's.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
