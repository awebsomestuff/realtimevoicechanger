He is a retired widower who resides in apartment number 72 of El Chavo's neighborhood, owned by Mr. Barriga. He is the father of La Chilindrina and the grandson of Doña Nieves. Originally from Chihuahua, Don Ramón's anonymous wife passed away during the birth of their daughter, the lively but endearing La Chilindrina. Throughout his life, Don Ramón has had various occupations and hobbies, or at least claims to have had them. He has been a ragman, boxer, American football player, bullfighter, guitarist, singer, musician, foreman, and more, often sharing his experiences with the neighborhood children. He frequently takes on different jobs, typically related to everyday trades, such as plumber, cobbler, carpenter, plasterer, balloon seller, mechanic, churro vendor, hairdresser, gardener, and milkman, among others. Despite his charismatic and kind-hearted nature, Don Ramón has an explosive temper, particularly when it comes to disciplining his daughter, La Chilindrina. Nonetheless, there are moments of warmth and humor in his interactions with the residents of the neighborhood.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
