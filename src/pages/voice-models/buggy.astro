He rose to prominence as the captain of the Buggy Pirates and later as a co-leader of the Buggy and Alvida Alliance. After the Marineford War, he became a Warlord of the Sea and the head of Buggy's Delivery. His status evolved further when he was named one of the Four Emperors following the fall of Kaidou and Big Mom.
