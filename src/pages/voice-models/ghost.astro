While default shells are tetrahedral and white with orange accents, a plethora of cosmetic shells exists. Each Ghost boasts a unique personality and often lacks a name unless coined by their Chosen. Upon reviving their Chosen, Ghosts forge a lifelong bond, marked by neural symbiosis. Some Ghosts tirelessly seek their destined Chosen, while others, resigned to fate, find new purposes like aiding the Vanguard's Spectral Network. In the event of their Chosen's demise, Ghosts may fall into a temporary catatonic state, rendering them unable to resurrect Guardians. Yet, they serve crucial functions for Guardians, from awakening ancient technology to providing strategic insights and resurrection. Despite their vital roles, Ghosts exert no direct control over their Guardians' actions. Remarkably, some Ghosts have chosen Hive partners, raising questions about loyalty and purpose within the Lightbearer community.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
