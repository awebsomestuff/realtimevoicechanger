Renowned as the most powerful and feared variant within Mount Massive Asylum, Walker's modus operandi often involves decapitating his victims, contributing to his terrorizing presence. Throughout the narrative, protagonist Miles Upshur constantly evades encounters with Walker, who exhibits an intriguing ability to access nearly every area of the facility. Notable instances include Walker's assault on Miles, hurling him into the Administrative Block, and a tense confrontation in the security room orchestrated by the asylum's blackout. Walker's relentless pursuit culminates in a chilling scene where, amidst chaos and danger, he relentlessly pursues Miles, showcasing his relentless and formidable nature.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
