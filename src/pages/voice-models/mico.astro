He features moderately low health, moderate damage output, very fast movement speed, and high utility with his attacks and Super, although he is hampered by having the slowest reload speed among all brawlers. Mico's attack involves leaping over obstacles, dealing damage to enemies within a small radius upon landing. His Super is a jump that damages and pushes enemies back upon landing. His first gadget, Eardrum Breaker, launches three long-range projectiles that slow and damage enemies on impact. His second gadget, Presto, extends the range of his next attack. Mico's first Star Power, Primate Business, allows his next attack to eliminate ammunition from hit enemy brawlers while replenishing his own. His second Star Power, Platinum Disc, doubles the damage to special targets. His Hypercharge, Sound Check, stuns enemies with his next Super.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n";
