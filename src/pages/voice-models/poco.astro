His attack involves strumming his guitar, releasing harmful musical notes over a wide area. His super releases a larger and faster musical wave that heals himself and any allies within its range. His first gadget, \"Tuning Fork,\" generates a circular musical wave around him that heals him and his allies within seconds. His second gadget, \"Protective Tune,\" heals allies from any status effects and shields them from such effects for a short time over a large area. His first Star Power, \"Screeching Solo,\" allows Poco's normal attack to heal allies it hits. His second Star Power, \"Encore,\" enables his super to deal moderate damage to enemies it strikes.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
