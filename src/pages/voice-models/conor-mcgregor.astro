McGregor made history as the first fighter ever to hold two UFC titles simultaneously, reigning as both the featherweight and lightweight champion. Renowned for his role in the headline bout of the most-watched UFC event in history (UFC 229), McGregor is hailed as Ireland's greatest fighter. His swift victory over José Aldo in just 13 seconds earned him the fastest knockout in UFC title fight history, while his TKO win against Eddie Alvarez at UFC 205 secured his second belt. McGregor also claimed simultaneous featherweight and lightweight titles in the British MMA league Cage Warriors. Additionally, McGregor ventured into boxing, competing in the super welterweight division and facing Floyd Mayweather Jr. in the highly publicized Money Fight in 2017.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
