A notable feature is a small bite missing from the top of his left ear, likely referencing his candy nature. His mouth allows for anthropomorphic expressions, and his mustache and goatee are made of sugar crust, with only two small, widely spaced teeth on his lower jaw. Known as Gummibär in German, Gummy Bear in English, and Osito Gominola in Spanish, he is a multilingual character and leads a virtual band aimed at children, performing songs about the gummy bear across various albums, including \"I Am Your Gummy Bear\" (2007) and \"La La Love to Dance\" (2010). The original song \"I Am A Gummy Bear\" has amassed 3 billion views on YouTube.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n";
