She is a quiet and thoughtful girl, raised by two attentive and loving parents. Incredibly resourceful, she spends her time building elaborate fantasies in her treehouse rather than watching cartoons or playing with dolls. While not easily frightened, she tends to stay silent when nervous. Reserved and shy, her actions speak louder than her words.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
