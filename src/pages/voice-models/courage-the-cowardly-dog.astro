Dilworth for Cartoon Network. Set in the fictional town of Nowhere, Kansas, the show follows Courage, a timid yet loyal dog who resides with an elderly couple in a farmhouse. Together, they face bizarre and often unsettling adventures, frequently involving paranormal or supernatural elements. Dilworth initially presented the series as a pilot titled The Chicken from Outer Space, which aired on Cartoon Network in 1996. Despite not winning an Academy Award, the pilot was greenlit for a full series, which aired from 1999 to 2002. Known for its dark humor and surreal atmosphere, the show garnered nominations for several awards, including Golden Reel Awards and an Annie Award.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
