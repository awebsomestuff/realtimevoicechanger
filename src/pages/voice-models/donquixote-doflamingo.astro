Born to Donquixote Homing and elder brother to Donquixote Rosinante, he's a member of the Donquixote Family, the ruling royal family of Dressrosa for eight centuries. Doflamingo commands the Pirates and operates under the alias Joker in the underworld, being the least influential of the Underworld Emperors. Prior to becoming a Warlord, he had a bounty of Belly 340,000,000. Doflamingo's downfall came after his defeat by Monkey D. Luffy, leading to his expulsion from the Warlords and imprisonment in Level 6 of Impel Down. Initially not perceived as a significant threat by the Straw Hat Pirates, his actions during the events in Punk Hazard thrust him into the spotlight as the primary antagonist of the Dressrosa Saga.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
