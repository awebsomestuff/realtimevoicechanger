After starting their training under Goku and later under Piccolo when Goku had to return to the other world, the boys faced initial setbacks with failed fusion attempts, resulting in comically ineffective versions of Gotenks. However, persistence paid off when they successfully fused on their third attempt, creating the powerful warrior Gotenks, who immediately demonstrated immense potential. Despite his remarkable abilities, doubts remained about his capacity to defeat Majin-Boo. After a series of battles and transformations, including reaching Super Saiyan 3, Gotenks showed impressive combat skills but ultimately, their efforts were thwarted when Majin-Boo absorbed Gotenks along with Piccolo, leading to further challenges in the saga.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</div>";
