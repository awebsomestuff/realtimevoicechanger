Initially the world's most nefarious villain, Gru's notorious title was usurped by Vector, who famously stole the Great Pyramid of Giza. In response, Gru plotted to outdo Vector by stealing the Moon, an act that would reclaim his title through committing the \"crime of the century.\" However, his plans are disrupted by Vector, leading Gru to unexpectedly become the adoptive father of three girls: Margo, Edith, and Agnes. Initially intending to use the girls to aid his grand heist, Gru grows fond of them. After successfully stealing the Moon, he chooses to return it upon learning that Vector has kidnapped his daughters. Now around 40 years old, Gru's character arc from villain to protective father highlights his profound transformation.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
