Introduced to computers at a tender age of three, Dalas delved into 3D modeling and photo editing by the time he reached 11–12 years old. Despite enrolling in a multimedia degree, he opted to discontinue his studies. In 2005, with the inception of YouTube, Dalas began his journey by adding nonsensical subtitles to foreign film trailers. His channel, DTeamVlogs, gained traction in 2010 with a viral video criticizing Justin Bieber's fans, titled La niña believer. Subsequently, he launched his main channel, Dalas Review, in 2012. Notably, he garnered the Tolete Award in July 2017 for his parody of the Canarian accent in a video titled Imitating 15 accents of Spain and Latin America (Very Bad). In a unique move, in January 2021, Dalas created a Pornhub account with the intention of sharing videos focused on sexual education.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
