Initially appearing cheerful and friendly, he quickly alters his expression based on his emotions. While initially presenting himself as kind and amicable, he progressively reveals his true malevolent nature, attempting to thwart the protagonist and often referring to everyone as idiots. Although initially frightened by Toriel, he reappears in the Ruins, commenting on the character's actions up to that point. Throughout the game, Flowey demonstrates a malicious and cruel character, constantly reproaching the protagonist for disregarding his kill or be killed philosophy and expressing a desire to destroy the world. He exhibits cunning manipulation skills, particularly evident in the True Pacifist Route's ending, where he persuades the protagonist to gather as many monster souls as possible. Additionally, he possesses a malevolent sense of humor, exemplified in his final battle transformation into Photoshop Flowey.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
