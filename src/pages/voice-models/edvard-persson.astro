Hailing from Sankt Pauli parish in Malmö, Scania, he left an indelible mark on his homeland and beyond. Renowned throughout Sweden, Persson's cinematic and musical works often evoke the essence of his beloved province, Scania. His popularity extended to Denmark, where he was a beloved entertainer. Following an invitation to the United States in 1947, Persson embarked on a 100-day tour, performing in \"Swedish communities\" across the nation. Notably, he staged 36 concerts in New York City and an additional 35 cities across America, solidifying his international acclaim.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
