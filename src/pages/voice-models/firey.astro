Throughout his journey, he showcased his competitive spirit, initially aligning with various teams such as the Squishy Cherries, Squashy Grapes, and Another Name. Despite emerging victorious, Firey's dreams of claiming Dream Island were dashed when Leafy seized it out of spite. In subsequent seasons like BFDIA and BFB, Firey faced new challenges, experiencing both triumphs and setbacks, including his unexpected elimination in Meaty. His resilience, however, ensured his presence in later installments like IDFB and BFB, where he navigated through alliances and eliminations, proving himself as a resilient contender in the ever-evolving battlefield of BFDI.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
