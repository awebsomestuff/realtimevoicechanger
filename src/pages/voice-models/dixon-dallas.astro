Operating under his primary alias iAmJakeHill, he explores an eclectic mix of genres, including alternative rock, pop-punk, rap, indie-pop, and metal. Under the persona ur pretty, Hill delves into pop-punk territory, weaving queer-inclusive lyrics into his songs. Notably, his first release, Keep Riding Me, dropped on October 10, 2021, followed by I'll Never Let You G on December 8, 2021, focusing on themes of love and relationships. Transitioning to his Dixon Dallas alter ego, he teased his first country single on May 30, 2023, eventually releasing Like Whiskey on June 20, 2023, featuring candid lyrics about gay intimacy. Embracing his divergence from conservative Southern norms, Hill acknowledges the speculation about his sexuality but asserts that it's inconsequential to his artistry. Continuing his musical journey, he dropped singles like F-150 and Better Without You on August 15, 2023, centering on themes of gay love and intimacy. Hill's exploration of identity and expression continues to evolve with releases like Something To Feel on November 3, 2023, and Leave This All Behind on February 5, 2024, further enriching the Dixon Dallas discography.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
