As a member of the Chaotix Detective Agency, alongside Vector the Crocodile and Charmy Bee, Espio diligently solves cases using his unique abilities. Initially portrayed as boastful, he evolved into a calm, soft-spoken, and disciplined individual, whose cautious nature and heartfelt character make him a vital asset to his team, balancing out the antics of his friends. With golden and brown eyes and a horn-like nose, Espio sports white gloves with lilac gemstones and thick black cuffs with gray details and yellow dots. Matching cuffs adorn his feet, while his purple shoes feature black lines. Standing at a moderate height of 110 centimeters, Espio embodies both stealth and reliability within the Chaotix team.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
