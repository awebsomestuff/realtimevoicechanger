It attacks by throwing a seed bomb that bounces off the ground and walls, exploding upon enemy contact or after a set time, dealing area damage. For its Super, Sprout launches a Super Seed, creating a temporary wall-like barrier upon landing. Its first Gadget, \"Vegetal Fertilizer,\" allows Sprout to consume a nearby bush to heal 1800 health points. Its second Gadget, \"Transplant,\" destroys an active Super to fully recharge its Super ability. Sprout's first Star Power, \"Overgrowth,\" enhances the explosion radius of its next attack every five seconds, while its second Star Power, \"Photosynthesis,\" provides a damage-reducing shield when in a bush and briefly after exiting one.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
