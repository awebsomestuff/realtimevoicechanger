Portrayed by Ashley Johnson through motion capture, Ellie embarks on a journey across a post-apocalyptic United States with Joel, tasked with finding a cure for an infection to which Ellie is immune. While players briefly control her in certain segments, most of her actions are driven by the game's AI, aiding in combat and enemy detection. In the prequel downloadable content, The Last of Us: Left Behind, players delve into Ellie's past and how she and her friend Riley were infected. Bella Ramsey portrays Ellie in the HBO series adaptation of The Last of Us.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
