He excels in mobility, primarily due to his Super, which is a short, fiery dash that not only propels him forward but also leaves a scorching trail that harms enemies upon contact. Additionally, Stu can fully charge his Super with just one successful hit. His versatility is further enhanced by two gadgets: Speed Zone boosts the movement speed of Stu and nearby allies, while Breakthrough allows his Super to obliterate obstacles and hurl the debris at enemies for extra damage. His abilities are augmented by two Star Powers: Zero Drag, which extends the range of his Super, and Gaso-Heal, which provides a minor heal each time the Super is activated.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
