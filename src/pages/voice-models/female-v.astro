As the central protagonist of Cyberpunk 2077, players assume control of V, with the freedom to customize their gender, appearance, attributes, perks, and Lifepaths. These choices significantly influence the narrative trajectory, with players selecting from three distinct backgrounds: Nomad, Streetkid, or Corporate. Each Lifepath offers a unique starting point within Night City, accompanied by a tailored introductory questline and equipment, weaving a diverse tapestry of experiences throughout the game.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
