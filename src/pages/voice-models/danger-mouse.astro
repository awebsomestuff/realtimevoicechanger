He is a member and co-founder of the bands Gnarls Barkley and Broken Bells, and has produced works for Gorillaz, The Black Keys, MF DOOM, Sparklehorse, Red Hot Chili Peppers, U2, and Norah Jones. In 2011, he released an album titled Rome, inspired by spaghetti western soundtracks, in collaboration with Italian composer Daniele Luppi, featuring Jack White and Norah Jones. The Grey Album by Danger Mouse was at the center of the Grey Tuesday protest on February 24, 2004, orchestrated by Downhill Battle, a group of music activists. Affiliated websites offered free downloads of the album for 24 hours in defiance of EMI's attempts to block its distribution. Similarly, Dark Night of the Soul, Danger Mouse's latest album, faced distribution issues due to a dispute with EMI. The album was released with only a blank CD and a note urging fans to download it from P2P networks, as it would not be officially available in physical or digital formats. This unconventional release strategy reflects the ongoing conflict between artists and record labels, as reported by DJ OcO from his current residence in the Bay of Cádiz.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"related-models\">\n  <h2>Related Voice Models</h2>\n  <div class=\"related-models-grid\">\n    <div class=\"icono\">\n      <a href=\"/voice-models/glenn-quagmire/\">\n        <img class=\"imagen-icono\" src=\"/uploads/2024/04/Glenn-Quagmire-Voice-Models-280x280.webp\" srcset=\"/uploads/2024/04/Glenn-Quagmire-Voice-Models-280x280.webp 280w\" sizes=\"140px\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Glenn Quagmire\">\n        <div class=\"texto-icono\">Glenn Quagmire</div>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"icono\">\n      <a href=\"/voice-models/gumball/\">\n        <img class=\"imagen-icono\" src=\"/uploads/2024/04/Gumball-Voice-Models-280x280.webp\" srcset=\"/uploads/2024/04/Gumball-Voice-Models-280x280.webp 280w\" sizes=\"140px\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Gumball\">\n        <div class=\"texto-icono\">Gumball</div>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"icono\">\n      <a href=\"/voice-models/meg/\">\n        <img class=\"imagen-icono\" src=\"/uploads/2024/04/Meg-Voice-Models-280x280.webp\" srcset=\"/uploads/2024/04/Meg-Voice-Models-280x280.webp 280w\" sizes=\"140px\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Meg\">\n        <div class=\"texto-icono\">Meg</div>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"icono\">\n      <a href=\"/voice-models/courage-the-cowardly-dog/\">\n        <img class=\"imagen-icono\" src=\"/uploads/2024/04/Courage-the-Cowardly-Dog-Voice-Models-280x280.webp\" srcset=\"/uploads/2024/04/Courage-the-Cowardly-Dog-Voice-Models-280x280.webp 280w\" sizes=\"140px\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Courage the Cowardly Dog\">\n        <div class=\"texto-icono\">Courage the Cowardly Dog</div>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"icono\">\n      <a href=\"/voice-models/fred-flintstone-alan-reed/\">\n        <img class=\"imagen-icono\" src=\"/uploads/2024/04/Fred-Flintstone-Voice-Models-280x280.webp\" srcset=\"/uploads/2024/04/Fred-Flintstone-Voice-Models-280x280.webp 280w\" sizes=\"140px\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Fred Flintstone (Alan Reed)\">\n        <div class=\"texto-icono\">Fred Flintstone (Alan Reed)</div>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"icono\">\n      <a href=\"/voice-models/fanboy/\">\n        <img class=\"imagen-icono\" src=\"/uploads/2024/04/Fanboy-Voice-Models-1-280x280.webp\" srcset=\"/uploads/2024/04/Fanboy-Voice-Models-1-280x280.webp 280w\" sizes=\"140px\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Fanboy\">\n        <div class=\"texto-icono\">Fanboy</div>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>";
