He's married to Wilma Flintstone and they have a daughter named Pebbles, residing in their cozy cave in Bedrock. Fred's closest friend is Barney, his neighbor, married to Betty. Living in the imaginative prehistoric setting of Bedrock, where dinosaurs and modernized cavepeople coexist, Fred enjoys a lifestyle with primitive versions of contemporary amenities like phones and cars. His famous exclamation, yabba dabba doo!, originated as his club's chant and became part of the show's theme song, extending to the 1994 live-action adaptation. Since the original series, Fred has remained a fixture in various spinoffs, live-action renditions, and commercial ventures.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
