He belongs to the Tarkatan, a nomadic mutant race that is a hybrid of vile demons from the Netherealm and inhabitants of the Outworld. Known for his gruesome, deformed appearance and brutal nature, Baraka is a fan favorite due to his retractable forearm blades. Despite his numerous battles against Earthrealm's warriors, Baraka shows no particular enmity towards Earth or its people, remaining loyal to his master.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
