Tolkien, is one of the main characters in the novels \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings,\" and also appears in \"The Silmarillion,\" which narrates his origins. Known by many names in Middle-earth, Gandalf is an istar (wizard), one of the Maiar spirits sent to Middle-earth during the Third Age to aid its inhabitants in the fight against the dark lord Sauron. In Aman, his name was Olórin, and he served Irmo and learned compassion and patience from Nienna. Chosen to be one of the Istari sent to Middle-earth, Gandalf arrived in the First Millennium of the Third Age, bearing the Ring of Fire, Narya, given to him by Círdan to kindle the hearts of the peoples of Middle-earth. Gandalf organized and accompanied Bilbo Baggins and the thirteen dwarves on their quest to Erebor in \"The Hobbit,\" where he discovered the elven sword Glamdring and Bilbo found the One Ring near Gollum's cave. Gandalf also participated in the White Council's efforts to expel Sauron from the Necromancer's fortress in Dol Guldur, ultimately revealing Sauron's true identity and helping to unite the Wise against him.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
