Born on March 21, 1955, in Glicério, São Paulo, Brazil, Bolsonaro's political career spans several decades, starting as a city councilor in Rio de Janeiro in 1988, before serving as a federal deputy for the state from 1991 to 2018.\n\nBolsonaro is known for his controversial and polarizing views. His political stance is often described as far-right, promoting conservative social policies, strong anti-corruption measures, and a pro-gun agenda. He has been a vocal critic of left-wing politics, advocating for a hardline approach against crime and drug trafficking, which has garnered him significant support as well as criticism. Bolsonaro's environmental policies, particularly regarding the Amazon rainforest, have been a subject of international concern. His government faced criticism for an increase in deforestation rates and for policies perceived as detrimental to environmental protection and indigenous rights.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
