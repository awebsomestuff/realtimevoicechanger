Engineered during General Boram Darkwill's reign, Briar was more monstrous than her creators anticipated. After a disastrously bloody first mission, it was clear that while she held great power, she was too dangerous for regular use. To manage her, a special pillory locked with a hemolite was crafted, controlling her destructive impulses. Yet, Briar's first taste of freedom saw her consuming both ally and foe alike, confirming her creators' fears about her uncontrollable nature.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
