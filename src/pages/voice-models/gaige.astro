Her unique skill allows her to control Deathtrap, a powerful robotic companion. Players who pre-ordered the game received Gaige for free. Outside of Borderlands 2, Gaige serves as a marketing tool, engaging with fans on Twitter and releasing ECHO logs. Originally a high school student from the planet Eden-5, Gaige shared her life on ECHOcast but saw her subscriber count decline over time. Despite this, she remained passionate about the history of Vaults, Eridium, and Pandora, considering her era to be incredibly exciting.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
