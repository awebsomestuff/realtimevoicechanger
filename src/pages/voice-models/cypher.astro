With an unwavering vigilance, he is always watching. Amir El Amari, also known as prince of the moon, originates from Rabat, Morocco, where he endured periods of poverty exacerbated by the activities of Kingdom Corporation. As an information broker, El Amari guards his own secrets as closely as the intel he collects, going to great lengths to maintain his anonymity, including wearing a black face-concealing mask at all times. Even as a member of the VALORANT Protocol, operating under the alias Cypher, he remains steadfast in his commitment to secrecy, unwilling to risk exposure by removing his mask, even to those closest to him.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
