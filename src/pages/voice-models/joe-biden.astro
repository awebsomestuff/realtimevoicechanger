Born on November 20, 1942, in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden has had a long and distinguished career in American politics, marked by personal tragedy, resilience, and a deep commitment to public service.\n\nBefore his presidency, Biden served as the 47th Vice President of the United States from 2009 to 2017 under President Barack Obama. Prior to his vice presidency, he was a United States Senator from Delaware for 36 years, making him one of the longest-serving senators in history when he resigned to assume the vice presidency. His legislative and foreign policy experience was a key aspect of his role as Vice President, particularly in areas such as international relations, criminal justice, and domestic policy issues including health care and violence against women.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
