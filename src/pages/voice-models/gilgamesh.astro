His story, recorded in the ancient epic poem known as the \"Epic of Gilgamesh,\" depicts him as a hero destined for greatness, facing challenges alongside his companion Enkidu. As the \"King of Heroes,\" Gilgamesh holds a unique status, not merely as a heroic king, but as the ruler of all heroes across mythologies worldwide. His legend serves as the archetype for countless hero tales, making him the origin of mythic heroism in human culture.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
