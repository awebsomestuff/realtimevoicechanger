In her doll form, Gwen shared joyful days with her creator, handling scissors while the seamstress stitched with needle and thread. Their evenings were spent under a dining table, engaging in playful duels between cutlery and scissors in the candlelit kitchen. However, these bright days eventually dimmed, and Gwen, left alone, forgot much over centuries, frozen and silent until magic unexpectedly turned her into a living girl. Awakening on a shadowy beach far from home, Gwen embraced life anew, marveling at the sensations of the world. Among the ancient debris on the shore, she found her creator's familiar sewing tools. Touching them triggered a burst of radiant mist from her hands, evoking a sense of security and warmth. But this magic also drew dark, twisting mists forming dreadful specters drawn obsessively to her. Despite their daunting presence, Gwen fought back with her now magically imbued scissors. Surrounded by these specters, suppressed memories of her creator, wounded and in despair, resurfaced along with the haunting face of a man named Viego. In this critical moment, Gwen realized the tools from her seamstress were not merely coincidences but a legacy and a strength she still carried. Harnessing sacred mist, she wove it into her attacks, dispersing the specters. Although victorious, Gwen sensed this battle was just the beginning. She now journeys across Runaterra, driven to restore joy to those afflicted, cherishing each moment of her newfound life and embracing her role as an unstoppable force of good.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n";
