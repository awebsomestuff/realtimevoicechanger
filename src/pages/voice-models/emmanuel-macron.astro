Formerly a civil servant and an investment banker, Macron worked for Rothschild & Cie before becoming an economic advisor to President François Hollande in 2012. He later served as Minister of Economy, Industrial Renewal, and Digital Affairs before founding the centrist political movement En Marche! in April 2016. Macron resigned as Minister of Economy in August of the same year to focus on building his party, leaving as the most highly regarded minister in the government and the preferred left-wing politician among the French populace. Macron's departure from the French Socialist Party was confirmed in August, solidifying his commitment to a centrist political agenda. Despite his relative political youth, Macron announced his candidacy for the 2017 French presidential elections, winning the first round with nearly 24% of the vote. He went on to win the second round against Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front, with 66.1% of the vote, becoming the youngest president in French history since Napoleon Bonaparte and the youngest member of the current G-20. Macron secured his reelection in the 2022 presidential elections, defeating Le Pen once again in the runoff.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"related-models\">\n  <h2>Related Voice Models</h2>\n  <div class=\"related-models-grid\">\n    <div class=\"icono\">\n      <a href=\"/voice-models/gandhi/\">\n        <img class=\"imagen-icono\" src=\"/uploads/2024/04/Gandhi-Voice-Models-280x280.webp\" srcset=\"/uploads/2024/04/Gandhi-Voice-Models-280x280.webp 280w\" sizes=\"140px\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Gandhi\">\n        <div class=\"texto-icono\">Gandhi</div>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"icono\">\n      <a href=\"/voice-models/adolf-hitler/\">\n        <img class=\"imagen-icono\" src=\"/uploads/2024/04/Adolf-hitler-280x280.webp\" srcset=\"/uploads/2024/04/Adolf-hitler-280x280.webp 280w\" sizes=\"140px\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Adolf Hitler\">\n        <div class=\"texto-icono\">Adolf Hitler</div>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"icono\">\n      <a href=\"/voice-models/joe-biden/\">\n        <img class=\"imagen-icono\" src=\"/uploads/2024/04/Joe-Biden-280x280.webp\" srcset=\"/uploads/2024/04/Joe-Biden-280x280.webp 280w\" sizes=\"140px\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Joe Biden\">\n        <div class=\"texto-icono\">Joe Biden</div>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"icono\">\n      <a href=\"/voice-models/vladimit-putin/\">\n        <img class=\"imagen-icono\" src=\"/uploads/2024/04/Putin-Voice-Models-280x280.webp\" srcset=\"/uploads/2024/04/Putin-Voice-Models-280x280.webp 280w\" sizes=\"140px\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Vladimit Putin\">\n        <div class=\"texto-icono\">Vladimit Putin</div>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"icono\">\n      <a href=\"/voice-models/giorgio-napolitano/\">\n        <img class=\"imagen-icono\" src=\"/uploads/2024/04/Giorgio-Napolitano-Voice-Models-280x280.webp\" srcset=\"/uploads/2024/04/Giorgio-Napolitano-Voice-Models-280x280.webp 280w\" sizes=\"140px\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Giorgio Napolitano\">\n        <div class=\"texto-icono\">Giorgio Napolitano</div>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"icono\">\n      <a href=\"/voice-models/luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva/\">\n        <img class=\"imagen-icono\" src=\"/uploads/2024/04/Luiz-Inacio-Lula-da-Silva-Voice-Models-280x280.webp\" srcset=\"/uploads/2024/04/Luiz-Inacio-Lula-da-Silva-Voice-Models-280x280.webp 280w\" sizes=\"140px\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva\">\n        <div class=\"texto-icono\">Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</div>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>";
