He retained some human-like features with subtle differences, such as moderate musculature, pale blue long and sharp nails, pale skin tone, and thick black eyebrows. His hair, described as silver or pale golden blonde, was shorter on the left side and longer on the right, with uneven strands extending in both directions. Part of his hair fell forward, covering part of his forehead while leaving his eyes and eyebrows visible. Many described his eyes as incredibly rare and beautiful, appearing to be formed by a variety of pastel rainbow tones fading into each other around his iris. This unusual appearance led people to believe in Doma's supposed ability to communicate with the gods, as claimed by his followers. Like all Upper Moons, he bore the kanji for Second Crescent in both eyes, previously bearing the kanji for Sixth Crescent, accrediting him as one of the twelve demon moons.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
