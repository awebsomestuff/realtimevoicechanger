Originally named Peeco, his design mimics a rudimentary MS Paint drawing, fitting the mod's low-quality aesthetic. Notably, Bico is characterized as homosexual and has the unique ability to shapeshift his arms. His name playfully references the Hey Better meme, adding a layer of internet culture humor to his character.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
