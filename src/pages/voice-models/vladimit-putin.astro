He has served as the President of the Russian Federation since 2012, previously holding the position from 2000 to 2008. His political career began after resigning from a sixteen-year tenure with the KGB, where he reached the rank of lieutenant colonel. Putin first entered the political realm in Saint Petersburg, moved to Moscow in 1996 to join President Boris Yeltsin’s administration, and swiftly ascended through key security positions to Prime Minister. After Yeltsin's resignation, Putin was appointed acting President, and subsequently elected president in early 2000, later re-elected in 2004. Due to constitutional term limits, he served as Prime Minister from 2008 to 2012, returned as President in 2012, and was re-elected in 2018. In 2021, following a referendum, he enacted constitutional amendments allowing potential re-election, extending his possible tenure until 2036.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
