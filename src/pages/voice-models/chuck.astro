His primary ability is to increase his impact speed, causing greater damage to wood and pigs. However, his impact is small and practically ineffective against stone and glass. His skill allows him to gather speed to maximize damage to pigs and their structures. According to the movie, he is Silver's brother.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
