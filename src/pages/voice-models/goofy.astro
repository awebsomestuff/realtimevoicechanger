Following his adventures alongside Mickey and Donald Duck, Goofy starred in his own series of short films from 1940 to 1960, depicting everyday activities and family situations. In 1954, he was joined by a nephew, Gilbert, and in 1979, by a cousin known as Sport Goofy. From the 1990s onwards, Goofy became the protagonist of the television series \"Goof Troop\", where he lives with his son Max. This series inspired two feature-length films: \"A Goofy Movie\" (1995) and \"An Extremely Goofy Movie\" (2000).</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
