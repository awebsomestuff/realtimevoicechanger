As a demon, Gyutaro presented a unique and somewhat grotesque appearance; he was tall, with an unnaturally muscular upper body contrasted by an incredibly thin waist and protruding pelvis. His skin was pale gray with black spots, and his face and body were marked with patterns resembling flowing water. Gyutaro's eyes were thin, with green and red irises set against bright orange sclerae, indicative of his rank within the demon hierarchy. He had disheveled hair tied back into a ponytail, which was black at the top and faded to a brighter green at the bottom. His attire consisted of loose blue pants and red fabric pieces draped around his body. As a human, Gyutaro had similar facial features and twisted anatomy, dressed in tattered kimonos that revealed his chest as he aged.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
