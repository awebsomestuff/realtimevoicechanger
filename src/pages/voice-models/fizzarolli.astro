He's depicted as a tall, male imp with a jester-like attire. His lime sclera and pink iris, along with a devilish tail sporting black stripes, give him a distinct appearance. Notably, his robotic arms and legs are retractable, granting him extraordinary flexibility. His jester hat seemingly floats, devoid of horns, adding to his whimsical demeanor. Fizzarolli's white clown face, accentuated by a red nose above the mouth, is complemented by a vibrant red and blue jester cap adorned with bells. His outfit features a bright red front with yellow accents, adorned with yellow hearts, while the back is vibrant blue with white accents and black hearts.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
