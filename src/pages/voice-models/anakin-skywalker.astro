During the Clone Wars, he earned fame as a fearless commander. However, driven by fear of loss, Anakin succumbed to the dark side, becoming Darth Vader, Sith Lord and apprentice to Emperor Darth Sidious. As Vader, he turned against the Jedi, nearly eradicating them. Ultimately, his final act of redemption was saving his son, Luke Skywalker, from Sidious, fulfilling his destiny by restoring balance to the Force.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
