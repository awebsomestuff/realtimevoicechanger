His career was marked by two influential studio albums, Vida (2010) and Muerte (2012), featuring hits like Pensando en ti and Jeremías 17-5. Tragically, he was found dead in January 2015 under mysterious circumstances that were later linked to foul play by his former manager. Canserbero's legacy lives on, epitomized by his posthumous recognition as the top rapper in Spanish rap history by Rolling Stone in 2023.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
