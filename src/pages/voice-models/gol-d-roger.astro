Roger, </strong>also known as Gold Roger, was the legendary captain of the Roger Pirates and the Pirate King. He conquered the entire Grand Line and reached Laugh Tale, becoming the first to do so in eight hundred years and discovering the legendary treasure known as \"One Piece\". It is said that he feared nothing and even smiled at his execution. His personality mirrored Luffy's, full of courage and determination, evident in his readiness to face new challenges and his love for adventure and combat. Although he could be impulsive and sometimes violent when angered, he also had a compassionate side, showing affection for children and rejecting the idea of allying to dominate the seas, preferring freedom over power and fame. His legacy as Pirate King transcends his death, inspiring future generations to pursue their dreams and freedom.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n \n\n</div>";
