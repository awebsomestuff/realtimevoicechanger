Modeled after the real-life USS Bataan, originally named USS Buffalo, she was introduced as a points reward during the Ashen Simulacrum event. In-game, Bataan is portrayed as shy and easily frightened, often depicted in her chibi animation as being scared of a Manjuu—a small bird-like mascot of the game's developer, Manjuu Co. Ltd. Despite her timid nature, she meticulously cares for her planes, knowing each by name.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
