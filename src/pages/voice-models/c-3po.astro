Constructed by Anakin Skywalker, C-3PO often provides comic relief alongside his counterpart, R2-D2. Portrayed by Anthony Daniels in nearly all the Star Wars theatrical releases, C-3PO's gold-plated frame and mismatched silver leg are iconic. His journey across different owners—from Shmi Skywalker to Leia Organa—places him at the heart of the galaxy's pivotal events, enhancing his role beyond mere translation duties.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
