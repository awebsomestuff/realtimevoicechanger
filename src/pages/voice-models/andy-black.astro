He is best known as the lead vocalist of the alternative metal band Black Veil Brides. Enduring bullying in school for his unique style and musical tastes, Biersack channeled his experiences into his creative pursuits. In addition to his work with Black Veil Brides, he launched a solo project under the name 'Andy Black,' exploring a different musical style influenced by 1980s music and gothic sounds. His solo venture is described as a side project, distinct from his band's activities.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
