As the daughter of Lucifer Morningstar and Lilith, Charlie stands as a beacon of optimism in a realm known for despair and eternal damnation. Unlike the traditional expectations of Hell's royalty, she possesses a compassionate heart, yearning to see the good in everyone and to offer a path of redemption for the damned souls. Disturbed by the annual purges that claim many demonic lives, Charlie proposes a novel, albeit controversial, solution: the Happy Hotel, a rehabilitation center aimed at giving Sinners a chance to work towards redemption and an eventual place in Heaven.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
