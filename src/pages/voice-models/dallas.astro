During heists, he dons an American flag mask and is voiced by Simon Kerr. By the time of PAYDAY 3, he is 54 years old. Dallas's early years were spent working for a Chicago mob, where he ascended from a club bouncer to a hitman, showcasing his intellect behind a facade of thuggery. His attempt to manipulate two rival mobs led to violent confrontations, resulting in a hit being placed on him. Despite the danger, Dallas survived and spent years in hiding, running an underground gun range and targeting drug dealers to disrupt the American drug trade. After a decade of isolation, he experienced a crisis of purpose and resolved to steal a weapons shipment, seeking out a criminal crew to join forces with.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
