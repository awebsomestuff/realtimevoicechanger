Amidst his routine of tending to his flock in Spinach Wastes, he stumbles upon Raditz's crash-landed pod, initially mistaking it for a meteor. Curiosity mixed with caution prompts him to investigate, armed with his trusty gun. However, his brave confrontation quickly turns to terror as Raditz emerges, showcasing superhuman abilities beyond the farmer's comprehension. Despite his valiant attempt to defend himself, the farmer's efforts prove futile against the overwhelming power of the extraterrestrial visitor.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
