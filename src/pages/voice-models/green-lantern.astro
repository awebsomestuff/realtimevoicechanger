These superheroes, typically members of the intergalactic police force known as the Green Lantern Corps, use their rings—which are powered by their imagination, bravery, and the electromagnetic spectrum of emotional willpower—to combat evil. While the original Golden Age Green Lantern's ring was magically powered, the rings of the Green Lantern Corps are technological creations by the Guardians of the Universe, given to those deemed worthy. Green Lantern is considered one of the most powerful superheroes in the DC Universe, capable of containing supernovas and black holes. The character has faced significant villains like Parallax, the Anti-Monitor, and his recurring foe, Sinestro. Alan Scott, the first Green Lantern, debuted in 1940, initially fighting ordinary criminals with his magic ring. The character was later reimagined as Hal Jordan in 1959, transitioning from fantasy to science fiction and introducing the concept of the Green Lantern Corps. Other notable Green Lanterns include John Stewart, one of DC's first Black superheroes, and later members like Guy Gardner, Kyle Rayner, Simon Baz, Jessica Cruz, and Jo Mullein.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
