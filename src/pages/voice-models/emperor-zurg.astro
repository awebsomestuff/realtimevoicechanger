Modeled after the fictional character of the same name, Zurg is depicted as the sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance and Buzz Lightyear's arch-nemesis within his fictional universe. Appearing in various forms, from intangible video game bosses to physical toys, Zurg is a persistent presence across different iterations of the Toy Story universe. Andy's Buzz acknowledges him as a threat, while he materializes as a toy chasing Al's Utility Belt Buzz and appears in Sunnyside Daycare as yet another version of himself.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
