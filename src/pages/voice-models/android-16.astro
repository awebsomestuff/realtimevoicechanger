Unlike his android counterparts, Android 16 was fully mechanical and initially designed as a pacifist, showing no desire to harm humans or nature. He stands out with his towering stature, red hair, and blue eyes, dressed in black under green armor adorned with the Red Ribbon Army logo, which later changes to the Capsule Corp logo after repairs by Dr. Brief. Despite his peaceful nature, his programming still directs him to target Goku, creating a complex conflict within him.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
