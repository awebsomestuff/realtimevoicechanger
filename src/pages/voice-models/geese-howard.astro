He leads the largest mafia cartel in the fictional city of Southtown. Apart from his appearances in Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting series, he also made cameo appearances in The King of Fighters '96, The King of Fighters 2002, and The King of Fighters '98 Ultimate Match. Additionally, he featured as a guest character in <strong>Tekken 7</strong> as part of the Season 1 DLC. Not much is known about Geese's childhood, though there are hints about his family background, including his potential stepfather Rudolph Krauser. Geese's training in martial arts, particularly in the Hakkyokuseiken school with Jeff Bogard, led to conflict and his subsequent vow of revenge against Jeff. Throughout his journey, Geese gained significant power, particularly notable during The Art of Fighting storyline, where he manipulated Takuma Sakazaki and his family, leading to conflicts and ultimately Takuma's defection. Geese's involvement in The King of Fighters series adds depth to his character, showcasing his strategic mind and determination to obtain power, as seen in his attempts to harness the Orochi power. Despite setbacks, Geese remains a formidable and intriguing figure within the SNK gaming universe, with his complex relationships and ambitions driving much of the narrative.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
