His most distinctive physical trait is his compulsive tendency to flip people off, often without any discernible reason. He leads the group known as Craig's gang. Craig's age progresses throughout the series, starting at eight years old in the first three seasons, reaching nine in Fourth Grade, and turning ten in the twelfth season's episode Perudemia 2: The Fright, as indicated by the candles on his birthday cake. Unlike his peers, Craig speaks with a deeper, more nasal voice.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
