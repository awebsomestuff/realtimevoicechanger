Jon Benjamin, serves as Brendon and Melissa's inept and abrasive soccer coach in the animated series. Despite his flaws, McGuirk views Brendon, Melissa, and Jason as friends and often lends them support, albeit in his own gruff manner. He attempts to fill a fatherly role for Brendon, occasionally showing glimpses of genuine care. McGuirk's futile efforts to connect with other adults, including Brendon's mother Paula and Melissa's father Erik, are often hindered by his brash demeanor. Despite his position as a soccer coach, McGuirk openly admits his disdain for the sport and reveals his lack of experience in playing it. In moments of intense anger, McGuirk resorts to alcohol and fits of rage, though he also harbors a troubled past as a Gulf War veteran, the authenticity of which remains uncertain.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
