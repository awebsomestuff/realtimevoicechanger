He is a former metalworker and union leader, and currently serves as the President of Brazil, a position he assumed on January 1, 2023, after defeating Jair Bolsonaro in the 2022 elections. This victory marked his third election as president, making him the first person in Brazil's history to achieve this. Lula's political journey began in the labor movement, where he played a significant role in organizing major strikes against Brazil's military dictatorship in the 1980s, significantly contributing to the regime's downfall. He first became president in 2003 and was reelected in 2006, leaving office in 2010 with high approval ratings. His presidencies are noted for significant social and economic reforms that helped transform Brazil into a major global economy and significantly reduced poverty through programs like Zero Hunger and Bolsa Familia.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n";
