Refusing to be bound by the conditions that confine most desert dwellers, she aspires to restore hope to the sands she calls home. With her tall stature, lightly bronzed skin, sky-blue eyes with 'cat-eye' yellow pupils, and black hair with blonde accents fashioned into cat ear-like accessories atop her head, Dehya cuts a striking figure. Her attire, comprising knee-high black boots, shorts, a belt, and elbow-length fingerless gloves, is adorned with golden armor pieces: kneepads and wrist guards on both sides; a shoulder pad, bracelet, and gauntlet on her right arm, and a single bracelet on her left bicep. Draped in a dark red feathered cloak with two golden ornaments hanging from it, her Pyro Vision hangs from her belt just behind her right hip.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
