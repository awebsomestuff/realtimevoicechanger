Rising to prominence after her role in the Disney Channel's television film Camp Rock and its sequel, Lovato debuted with the single This Is Me, reaching number nine on the Billboard Hot 100. Signing with Hollywood Records, she released her pop rock debut album Don't Forget in 2008, followed by Here We Go Again in 2009, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. Lovato's third studio album, Unbroken (2011), explored pop and R&B, featuring the platinum-certified single Skyscraper. Her subsequent albums, Demi (2013), Confident (2015), and Tell Me You Love Me (2017), showcased mature themes and soulful sounds, with Sorry Not Sorry becoming her highest-charting single at number six in the United States. In 2021, Lovato returned with her seventh album, Dancing with the Devil... The Art of Starting Over, and in 2022, she released her eighth album, Holy Fvck, revisiting her characteristic rock sound. Alongside her music career, Lovato appeared in various television shows and films, including Disney Channel's Sunny with a Chance, The X Factor, Glee, Will & Grace, and movies like Princess Protection Program, Smurfs: The Lost Village, and Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
