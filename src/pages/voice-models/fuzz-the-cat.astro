Despite his cheerful demeanor and bright, echoey voice, Fuzz harbors bitterness towards the loss of Flipnote and its creators. He eagerly engages with the June Archives community but reveals his anger through furious rants and unsettling tactics, using drastic animation changes and body horror to convey his discontent.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
