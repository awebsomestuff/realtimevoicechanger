Portrayed as the unofficial leader of the gang, Fred is often seen at the helm of the Mystery Machine in the original series. He is characterized as tall, strong, muscular, and with blonde hair. While typically depicted with black eyes in the Scooby-Doo series and its spin-offs, the film Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island portrays him with blue eyes, mirroring Daphne's eye color.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
