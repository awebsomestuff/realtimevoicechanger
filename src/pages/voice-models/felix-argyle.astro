Deeply devoted to Crusch, he was deeply troubled upon learning of her victimization by Ley. Engaging in battles against the Witch Cult's archbishops in Priestella, Felix demonstrates his unwavering loyalty to Crusch, often addressing himself in the third person as Ferri-chan but also adapting his identity as Ferris or Felix, or even using feminine pronouns as circumstances dictate. While obedient to Crusch's commands, he won't hesitate to oppose her if necessary, and relishes in teasing others, particularly those surprised by his gender identity, employing a playful and mischievous demeanor.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
