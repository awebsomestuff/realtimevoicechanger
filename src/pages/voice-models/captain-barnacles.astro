Known for his level-headed demeanor, he often debunks Kwazii's tales of sea monsters and commands deep respect from his crew. A lover of the Arctic Circle, where he grew up with his twin sister Bianca, Barnacles also dabbles in playing the accordion, albeit poorly, with his music only appreciated by a pod of Orcas. Despite his strengths, he reveals a vulnerability to claustrophobia, which he confronts with support from his team.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
