His bangs frame his face, with some meeting in the center of his forehead. He is tall and slender in physique. Dazai's attire consists of a long sand-colored trench coat, with the belt left untied. Underneath, he wears a black vest over a light blue pinstriped dress shirt. He sports a bolo tie, secured with a brown ribbon and a turquoise pendant. He also wears beige pants, dark brown shoes, and bandages wrapped around his entire body, leaving only his face, hands, and feet exposed. Beneath the bandages lie numerous scars from his failed suicide attempts. In the BONES anime adaptation, his light blue dress shirt is simplified to a solid blue. However, this change is not present in promotional art or the mobile game.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
