Known for its exceptional speed, it has the ability to appear and vanish suddenly during battles. Greninja dazzles its opponents with impressive agility before launching its attack using compressed water to form spinning shurikens sharp enough to slice through metal. Additionally, its uniquely long tongue wraps around its neck like a scarf, covering its mouth and nose, which enhances its ninja-like appearance. This dual aspect of frog and ninja traits makes Greninja a formidable and stealthy fighter in the Pokémon world.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
