Discovered inert and discarded by the brilliant inventor Viktor, Blitzcrank was reborn through the integration of a hextech crystal. This transformation endowed him with life and, unexpectedly, self-awareness. As he served Zaun's toxic sectors, Blitzcrank evolved beyond his initial programming, becoming a sentient being dedicated to aiding the citizens of Zaun, often with explosive results, demonstrating the unpredictable nature of self-improving AI.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
