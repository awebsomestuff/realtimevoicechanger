With a background in servers like 2b2t and SMPLive, Fit embarked on a journey to establish his reign over the virtual lands of Florida. Starting from Canada, he marched southward, gathering resources along the way with aspirations of becoming the ruler of Florida. Upon arrival, he swiftly amassed sugarcane and founded the Kingdom of Florida. Despite challenges like server crashes and hostile mobs, Fit persevered, determined to expand his faction's territory. However, he faced setbacks such as natural vegetation obstructing his plans, prompting him to humorously declare his intent to transform Florida into a vast parking lot. Despite technical issues and in-game challenges, Fit's determination to progress remained unwavering until the server eventually succumbed to overwhelming demand, temporarily halting his conquest.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
