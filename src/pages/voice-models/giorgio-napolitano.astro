Notably, he held the presidency at an advanced age, nearing 90 when he left office, and lived to the age of 98, making him the longest-lived Italian president. Known as \"Re Giorgio\" (King George) by his critics due to his extensive career in Italian politics, Napolitano was a longtime member of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) before joining the Democratic Party of the Left, the moderate post-communist successor to the PCI. Initially elected as a deputy in 1953, he served as Minister of the Interior from 1996 to 1998 during Romano Prodi's first government. In May 2006, he was elected by the Parliament as president, marking the first and only time a former communist militant held the position. Reelected in 2013, Napolitano resigned from the presidency in January 2015, cutting short his second term.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
