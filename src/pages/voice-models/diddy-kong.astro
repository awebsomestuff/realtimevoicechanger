He resides on the fictitious Donkey Kong Island in Kong Jungle and is recognizable by his red cap and shirt adorned with yellow stars. Unlike his uncle Donkey Kong, who is a gorilla Kong, Diddy is actually a spider monkey Kong. The difference in size distinguishes the two, especially in games where they appear together. Created by Rare Ltd, Diddy made his debut in 1994 on the Super Nintendo console in the game Donkey Kong Country as Donkey Kong's sidekick and nephew. Diddy idolized Donkey Kong and aspired to be a video game hero like him. DK tasked him with guarding their banana hoard at night.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
