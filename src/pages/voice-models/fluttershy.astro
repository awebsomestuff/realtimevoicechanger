Representing the element of Kindness, her name reflects her timid yet caring nature. Lauren Faust drew inspiration from a childhood toy named Posey from G1 MLP, originally referring to Fluttershy as Posey in her design. Fluttershy's cutie mark, three pink and cyan butterflies, bears resemblance to Sky Shimmer from G2 MLP. Notably, Fluttershy's name is shared with a G3 pony enthusiastic about photography, with Faust considering other names like Summer Azure and Spring Blossoms. Interestingly, her gaze was inspired by a habit of Faust's mother.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
