He is the eighth member to join the crew, doing so at the end of the Water 7 Arc. Originally named Cutty Flam and hailing from the South Blue, Franky was a member of Tom's Workers until a body-damaging incident led him to become a cyborg for healing purposes. He later became the leader of the Franky Family, a group of bounty hunters and ship dismantlers, adopting his current name to conceal his identity.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
