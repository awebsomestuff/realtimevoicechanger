His Super mirrors his main attack but obliterates obstacles. With his first Gadget, Quick Reload, he instantly replenishes two of his ammo. The second, Silver Bullet, transforms his next attack into a single piercing bullet, capable of destroying obstacles and dealing damage equivalent to two bullets from his primary attack. His first Star Power, Swift Boots, passively boosts his movement speed, while his second, Slick Boots, enhances the range and speed of his primary attack bullets. His Hyper Charge, Dual Grips, widens the area affected by his Super.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>";
